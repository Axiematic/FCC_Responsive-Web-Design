<h2> Media Queries </h2>

<p> Media Queries, a new technique introduced in CSS3, change the presentation of content based on different viewport (screen) sizes.</p>

<p>Media Queries consist of a media type and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on the styles are applied. You can multiple selectors and styles inside your media query.</p>

<p>Media query eg that returns the content when the device's width is less than or equal to 100px:</p>

<p>@media (max-width: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }</p>

<p>Media query eg returns the content when the device's height is more than or equal to 350px:</p>

<p>@media (min-height: 350px) { /* CSS Rules */ }</p>
