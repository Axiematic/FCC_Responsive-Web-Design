<h1> Applied Accessibility </h1>

<h2> Text alternative for images </h2>
<p> Alt text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative. This helps in case the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search resultsPer HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory. However, sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only. The img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string </p>

<p> eg. <img src="urltoimg" alt="explanation"> <p>

<h2> HTML5's new accessibility features </h2>

<h3> Appropriate tag names </h3> 

<p> <strong>main</strong> - wraps around the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners. The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to quickly navigate to the main content. If you've ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using a main tag automatically gives assistive devices that functionality. </p>

<p> <strong>article</strong> - a sectioning element, and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles. An article is for standalone content.

<p> <strong>section</strong> - similar to an article but it is a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a <strong>div</strong>. </p>

<p> <strong>header</strong> - used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag, and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages. <strong>header</strong> is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.</p>

<p> <strong>nav</strong> - This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page. If there are repeated site links at the bottom of the page, it isn't necessary to markup those with a nav tag as well. Using a footer is sufficient. </p>

<p> <strong>footer</strong> - Similar to header and nav, the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page. </p>

<p> <strong>audio</strong> - wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript. The includsion of the boolean attribute "controls" specifies that audio/video controls should be displayed ie. Play, Pause etc. </p>

<p> eg. </p>
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>

<p> <strong>figure / figcaption </strong> - These items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure. For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments.</p>

<p> eg. </p>
<figure>
  <img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo of Camper Cat executing a roundhouse kick">
  <br>
  <figcaption>
    Master Camper Cat demonstrates proper form of a roundhouse kick.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h4> In summary: </h4>

<ul>
<li> "div" - groups content.</li>
<li> "section" - groups related content.</li>
<li> "article" - groups independent, self-contained content.</li>
<li> "header" - wraps around introductory information or navigation links.</li>
<li> "nav" - wraps around navbar links. </li>
<li> "footer" - contain copyright information or links at the bottom pf the page.</li>
<li> "audio" - wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Appropriate attributes in forms</h3>

<p> <strong>label</strong> - wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The <strong>for</strong> attribute on a <strong>label</strong> tag explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers. The value of the for attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the form control</p>

<p> eg. </p>
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>

<p> <strong>fieldset / legend </strong> - The <strong>fieldset</strong> tag surrounds an entire grouping of radio buttons to indicate a user must choose one option from a set. It often uses a <strong>legend</strong> tag to provide a description for the grouping, which is read by screen readers for each choice in the fieldset element. These are not needed if the choice is self-explanatory eg male or female</p>

<p> eg. </p>
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
    <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
    <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
    <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
    <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
    <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
    <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>

<p> <strong>Date picker</strong> - the <strong>type</strong> attribute indicates what kind of inpuit wwill be created. HTML5 introduced a date picker which makes filling in forms much easier. </p>

<h2>Elements only visable  to a screen reader with custom  CSS</h2>

<p> The following CSS will make a visual format (like a chart) more SR fieldy as a hidden alternative format (like a table). The following CSS will accomplish this: </p>

<p>
.sr-only { <br>
  position: absolute; <br>
  left: -10000px; <br>
  width: 1px; <br>
  height: 1px; <br>
  top: auto; <br>
  overflow: hidden; <br>
} <br>

</p>

<p> Display: none; or visibility: hidden; hides content for everyone, including screen reader users. Zero values for pixel sizes, such as width: 0px; height: 0px; removes that element from the flow of your document, meaning screen readers will ignore it </p>

<h2> Improve Readability with Suffcient Contrast ratio's </h2>

<p> Low contrast between the foreground and background colors can make text difficult to read. Sufficient contrast improves the readability of your content </p>

<p> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black </p>

<p> There are tools online to caluculate this ratio such as <a href="http://contrast-ratio.com">contrast-ratio</a> </p>

<h2> Avoid Colorblindness Issues by Using Sufficient Contrast </h2>

<p> Colour alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it. </p>

<p> Colorblind users have trouble distinguishing some colors from others - usually in hue but sometimes lightness as well. You may recall the contrast ratio is calculated using the relative luminance (or lightness) values of the foreground and background colors. </p>

<p> In practice, the 4.5:1 ratio can be reached by darkening the darker color and lightening the lighter one with the aid of a color contrast checker. </p>

<h2> Tabindex to Add Keyboard Focus to an Element </h2>

<p> The HTML tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard focus. When it's on a tag, it indicates that element can be focused on. The value (an integer that's positive, negative, or zero) determines the behavior. </p>

<p>Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them.</p>

<p>Note - A negative tabindex value (typically -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. This method is generally used to bring focus to content programmatically (like when a div used for a pop-up window is activated. Using tabindex also enables the CSS pseudo-class :focus to work on the p tag.</p>

<p> The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of elements. This is achieved when the value of the attribute is set to a positive number of 1 or higher.</p>

<p>Setting a tabindex="1" will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence of specified tabindex values (2, 3, etc.), before moving to default and tabindex="0" items. </p>

<p>It's important to note that when the tab order is set this way, it overrides the default order (which uses the HTML source). This may confuse users who are expecting to start navigation from the top of the page. This technique may be necessary in some circumstances </p>
